            "body": "\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tOver the course of my pregnancy it has become even more apparent that I am in love with Mexican foods. &nbsp;I crave enchiladas, tacos, salsa, and all things Mexican food all day long! &nbsp;\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tI decided it was time that we have some enchiladas again and this time to use Guacamole as a main ingredient in the enchiladas. &nbsp;\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tNot only did my husband nearly eat the entire pan, he also said that was the best meal he thought he ever had. &nbsp;\r\n\r\n\tI think it was mainly the guacamole but also the enchilada sauce was on the spicy side. &nbsp;I am not a spicy foods fan, so I like things mild. &nbsp;He loves spicy though and was so happy to have a spicy Mexican dish! &nbsp;\r\n\r\n\t&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\tIngredients\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1 1/2 Lbs Chicken Breast, Cooked and Shredded (About 2 Cups)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1 Regular Size Can of Rotel with Green Chilies, Drained\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4 Green Onions, Diced\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1/4 Cup Cilantro, Chopped\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2 6oz Packets of Organic Wholly Guacamole\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t12 6inch Corn Tortillas\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2 Cups of Shredded Sharp Cheddar Cheese\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2 Cups Red Enchilada Sauce (Canned or Homemade)\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tDirections\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tBegin by preheating the oven to 350*.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tAt this point the chicken should be cooked and shredded. &nbsp;Add the chicken to a bowl and mix in the Rotel, Onions, Cilantro, and Guacamole. &nbsp;Be sure this is coated well.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tNext using a small skillet warm up the corn tortillas for 2-3 minutes to make them more&nbsp;pliable&nbsp;to use. &nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tFill each tortilla with the chicken mixture, then fold them and place seam side down on a greased 9x13 baking dish. &nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOnce you have repeated this for the remaining tortillas, pour the enchilada sauce evenly over the dish and then sprinkle evenly with the cheese.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tBake for 15 minutes until the cheese is fully melted.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tLet cool for 5 minutes and serve.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tEnjoy!\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWholly Guacamole: it&#39;s a whole lot more than dip.

It is great as chips and dips or spread on top of sandwiches and burgers, but it has such great flavor that I love to add it to all kinds of food.\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tI recently decided to change up our hamburgers by adding some guacamole to them and they turned out great.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tNow, I did not just serve the burgers with guacamole, I acutally added it into the meat along with some bacon and the flavor was amazing.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe combination of the guacamole throughout the meat and the bacon added to it, made for a seriously good hamburger.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tTop it with swiss cheese and it is even better.\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tGuacamole Bacon Swiss Burger\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIngredients\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2 pounds ground beef\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1 - 7 ounce package Wholly Guacamole\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t6 pieces of bacon, cooked and chopped\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t6 -8 slices of swiss cheese, or cheese of your choice\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t6-8 hamburger buns\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tlettuce, extra guacamole, or additional desired toppings\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tDirections\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tCombine bacon, ground beef, and guacamole. Mix until combined and form into patties. (I made 8 hamburger patties, but this will depend on how large you make them. You do not want to make these too large because it is a wet burger and they will fall apart.)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tGrill or cook hamburgers until desired doneness. I grilled them over medium high heat for about 4-5 minutes on each site.&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tServe on a hamburger bun with swiss cheese, additional guacamole, and other desired toppings.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWholly Guacamole: it&#39;s a whole lot more than dip.

            "body": "\r\n\tThe glorious avocado has a special place in my heart. My grandparents had an avocado ranch in California in the 1960&#39;s thru the late 1980&#39;s.&nbsp; It was by far one of my most favorite places to visit.&nbsp; I would wake up in the cool foggy California mornings and go walking in the groves looking for tasty avocados for us to share in our meals for that day. I can remember how the groves smelled, how the avocados tasted fresh from the tree and how much fun it was to make guacamole with my grandmother, my very own master guacamole artist. Thru the years I have learned that avocados and guacamole are more than just a dip or topping, you can use it in so many ways, soups, eggs, burgers and so much more.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\tThese days life is even easier, you don&#39;t have to wait for your avocados to ripen for a few days, all you have to do is grab a box of already prepared Wholly Guacamole from the produce section of your local market and you can create to your hearts content. I love Wholly Guacamole for one reason... If you read the ingredients on the back of the box, it reads like my guacamole recipe. It&#39;s not made with crazy fillers or artificial ingredients. I LOVE that!\r\n\r\n\tToday I&#39;ve created a fun side dish that will be perfect for your next taco or fajita night and it&#39;s so much better than the standard rice and beans. It&#39;s a lovely Wholly Guacamole Custard with a Spicy Corn Relish... YUM!\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t&nbsp;\r\n\t&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIngredients\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1 cup half-and-half\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1/2 cup whole milk\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1 egg\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1 egg yolk\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2 oz. room temperature cream cheese\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t14 oz. of organic Wholly Guacamole\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1 1/2 tsp. salt\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1/8 tsp. freshly ground pepper\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2 cups fresh or frozen thawed corn\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1 cup quartered grape tomatoes\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1/4 cup diced red onion\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1 tbsp. finely minced cilantro\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1-2 tbsp. diced pickled jalapeno {nacho jalapenos}\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1/2 lime, juiced\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tsalt and pepper to taste\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tDirections\r\n\t\r\n\t\tPreheat oven to 325 degrees and prepare your bain-marie to cook your custard in... Don&#39;t be scared, a bain-marie is a large glass baking dish with small ramekins placed inside. Once the ramekins are full of the custard you fill the baking dish half way with hot water, place in the oven and then bake.\r\n\t\r\n\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIn a blender add the half-and-half, milk, egg, egg yolk, cream cheese, Wholly Guacamole, salt and pepper. Blend until smooth and creamy. Pour mixture into 6 small ramekins in your large baking dish.&nbsp; Add the hot water and placed in the oven. Bake at 325 degrees for one hour. Remove from the oven after the custard is fully set, let cool for ten minutes and then place in the refrigerator for at least one hour.\r\n\t\r\n\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIn a separate bowl combine the corn, tomatoes, onion, cilantro, jalapenos, lime juice, salt and pepper.

Steak houses, sushi bars, hip little gastro-pubs.\r\n\r\n\tNow, we check our list of &ldquo;kid-eat free&rdquo; restaurants, spray sanitizer all over the table our crew is given, and spend the rest of our time out cutting food, muttering threats to &ldquo;stay in your SEAT&ldquo;, and apologizing to those around us.\r\n\r\n\tSince we simply can&rsquo;t drop everything whenever we want and head to our favorite sushi bar, the Husband and I have become adept at creating our own sushi rolls at home.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tThis&nbsp;Spicy Houston Sushi Roll&nbsp;is a super easy and spicy twist on the classic California Roll.\r\n\r\n\tJust five ingredients! &nbsp;Whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned sushi roller or a novice, these ingredients quickly come together for perfect meal . .. after the Kidlets have gone to bed, of course.\r\n\r\n\tSpicy Houston Sushi Rolls\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIngredients\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t6 cups cooked and cooled jasmine rice\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4-6 sheets of Nori\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1 package of Spicy Wholly Guacamole\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1 8-oz Imitation Crab Legs\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1/4 cup of Toasted Sesame Seeds*\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tTools\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tPlastic wrap\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tBamboo Rolling Mat\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSharp Knife\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tWater\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tDirections\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tUnroll your bamboo mat or towel out onto a table or other hard service.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLay a piece of plastic wrap on top of the bamboo mat and then put roughly 1 cup of cooked rice out on the plastic wrap, spreading it till it&rsquo;s about 1/2 inches thick all over.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tPut a sheet of the dried Nori on top of the cooked rice.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tOn top of the nori, spoon a couple or tablespoons (or more, if you love spice) of the Spicy Wholly Guacamole into a &ldquo;line&rdquo; down the nori sheet.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tNext, take one imitation crab leg and cut it in half length-wise. Place the two halves end to end on the nori, next to the spicy guacamole.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tWet your hands with water and then begin tightly rolling the rice/nori inward and over the filling, rolling away from you. You can use the plastic covered mat to help shape the sushi as your roll it.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tAfter the roll has been formed, use the bamboo mat one more time and press it lightly over the sides of the sushi roll, &ldquo;squaring it up&rdquo;.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tNext, sprinkle the top of the formed roll with toasted sesame seeds.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tDip a SHARP knife in hot water and cut thick slices, using a light sawing motion.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tPlace the slices on a plate and serve with your favorite condiments.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t*How To Toast Sesame Seeds\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tSpread sesame seeds onto a cookie sheet and place the sheet under a broiler.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tWatch closely, letting the seeds toast for a couple of minutes till they begin to turn golden brown.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tPull before they burn!
